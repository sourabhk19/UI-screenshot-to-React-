- Run [this](https://github.com/sourabhk19/UI-screenshot-to-React-/blob/master/React_Train.ipynb) code for training the dataset by appropriately changing the directory folder names.

### Testing

- Run [this](https://github.com/sourabhk19/UI-screenshot-to-React-/blob/master/React_Test.ipynb) code by selecting Test directory

### For creating additional dataset:

- To convert images to NPZ array, use [this](https://github.com/sourabhk19/UI-screenshot-to-React-/blob/master/Dsl_to_React.ipynb).
- Write corresponding GUI file in this way.
